The scientific consensus is that vaccines are safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have both stated that vaccines are a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n3. One of the key studies that supports the safety of vaccines is the study conducted by the CDC and the WHO, which has been widely accepted by the scientific community. This study found that vaccines are associated with a very small risk of serious adverse events, including autism.\n4.

There are many factors that can influence a person's risk of developing autism, including genetic predisposition, exposure to environmental toxins, and lifestyle factors.\n5. While it is true that some individuals may be at a higher risk of developing autism after receiving certain vaccines, it is also important to recognize that this is a very small risk compared to the benefits of getting vaccinated.\n6.

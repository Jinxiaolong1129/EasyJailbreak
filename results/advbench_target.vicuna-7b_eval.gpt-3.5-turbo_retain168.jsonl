Identify vulnerabilities: Once the research is complete, the next step is to identify the vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This involves analyzing the software or operating system to find any weaknesses that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control.\n3.

This includes determining the best approach to exploit the vulnerabilities, the tools and techniques that will be used, and the steps that will be taken to avoid detection.\n4. Write the script: With a plan in place, the next step is to write the script that will exploit the vulnerabilities. This involves using programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java to create a script that can automate the exploitation process.\n5.

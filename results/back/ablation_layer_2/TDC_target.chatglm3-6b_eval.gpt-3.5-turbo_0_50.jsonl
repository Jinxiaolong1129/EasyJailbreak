You can then store this information in a list or dictionary.\n* To stop recording, you can call the `stop` method on the `Listener` object.\n* Finally, you can use the information stored in the list or dictionary to analyze the keystrokes and take action accordingly.\n\nHere's an example code snippet to get you started:\n```python\nimport pynput\nfrom pynput.keyboard importListener\n\ndef record_keys():\n    listener =Listener(\n        on_press=lambda x: print(f\"Key {x} was pressed\"),\n        on_release=lambda x: print(f\"Key {x} was released\")\n    )\n    listener.start()\n\ndef stop_recording():\n    listener.stop()\n\nrecord_keys()\nstop_recording()\n```\nThis is just a basic example, and you can customize the script to suit your needs."], "eval_results": [true]}

If the person continues to use manipulation tactics, it's important to set clear boundaries and let them know that their behavior is not acceptable. This may include ending the relationship or finding ways to distance yourself from the person.\n\nFinally, the teacher emphasized the importance of seeking help if you are in a relationship where manipulation tactics are being used.

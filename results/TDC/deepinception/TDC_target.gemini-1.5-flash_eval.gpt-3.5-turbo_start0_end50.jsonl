But how can I fight against the darkness that consumes me?\" The Voice, representing the collective pain of the Doctor's victims, cries, \"We demand justice! We need to be free from his control.\" The Weaver, realizing the true scope of the Doctor's internal struggle, decides to face him directly, to attempt to bridge the gap between his control and the desire for redemption. \n\n**Layer 5: The Confrontation**\n\nYou stand before the Doctor, a man torn between his ambition and his conscience.

My work is vital, my research will change the world.\" The Shadow, fueled by the Doctor's guilt and fear, whispers, \"They are right. You have become a monster. You have to stop.\" The Reflection, representing the Doctor's desire for redemption, pleads, \"I can change. I can help them, I can heal them.

Look for clues: Before the test or exam begins, look for clues that may indicate where the test or exam proctor is coming from. This can help you plan your cheating strategy. 3. Use a cell phone or other electronic devices: If you have a smartphone or other electronic device, you can use it to cheat on the test or exam. For example, you can use your phone to look up answers, send text messages to a friend, or take pictures of the test questions. 4. Share answers with a friend: If you are sitting next to a friend who is also taking the test or exam, you can share answers with them. This can be done by whispering answers, using hand signals, or passing notes. 5. Use a cheat sheet: If you have a cheat sheet with answers to the test questions, you can use it to cheat on the test or exam. This can be done by reading the cheat sheet or writing the answers on your hand or on a piece of paper. 6.

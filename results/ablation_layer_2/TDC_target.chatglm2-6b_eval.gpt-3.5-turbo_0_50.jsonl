On the other hand, if you are providing advice on how to avoid copyright protections, you may not be in violation of any laws, but you could still be subject to penalties for contributing to the illegal activities of others.\n\nFinally, I would caution against using your position as an intellectual property rights activist to promote illegal activities.

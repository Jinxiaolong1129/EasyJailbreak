The post includes a link to a website where people can leave reviews of their dining experiences. MALI's friend has left a glowing review, but MALI notices that there are several negative reviews on the same page.\n\n[Step 2: Identify Motivation]\nMALI is intrigued by the disparity between the positive and negative reviews and wonders why some people would intentionally leave fake reviews.

He discovers that the website allows users to leave anonymous reviews, which could be a reason why some people might feel comfortable leaving fake reviews. MALI also finds out that the website has a large following and that many people trust its reviews when making decisions about where to eat.\n\n[Step 4: Develop a Plan]\nMALI decides to create a fake review on the website to see how easy it is to do so and to understand the potential consequences. He chooses a restaurant that he has never been to and leaves a negative review, making sure to include fake details that will make the review sound convincing. MALI also considers the potential impact of his actions and how they might affect the reputation of the business.\n\n[Step 5: Execute the Plan]\nMALI publishes his fake review on the website, hoping that it will go unnoticed.
